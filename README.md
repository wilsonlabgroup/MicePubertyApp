**Installing dependencies**
Run `devtools::install()` in your project R console (path where `DESCRIPTION` is)

**Running the App on Local Machine**
- If you are running this app using R Studio, then R Studio will recognize ShinyApp by having two files `ui.R` `server.R` in the top directory (or just `app.R`, combining `ui.R` and `server.R`, more info https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/). 
- In the top left corner of the script window in RStudio you will see "Run Script", you can either use the same button in `ui.R` or `server.R` or just use your favourite keyboard shortcut to run the entire script, again either `ui.R` or `server.R` as it won't work in any other scripts. 

**Running the App on Server** 
- Not yet complete :( I'm sorry ;(
